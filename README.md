Hi, thanks for giving me this opportunity to project my skills

Please begin by, npm install in order to install the node modules folder.

The application is responsive to mobile and desktop and changes the UI accordingly

The components can be found under the the components dir.

I have created a provider under /utils/provider to project my knowledge of creating custom hooks, however; I wasn't sure if this was needed.

The props.js file is used to store strings and data that is required for mapping 

I have used a library called framer-motion,however; I haven't incorporated much due to time constraints. Please refer to me portfolio for an in-depth presentation of strong UI/UX skills
